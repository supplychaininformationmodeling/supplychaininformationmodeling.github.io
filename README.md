# Supply Chain Information Modeling

The OASIS Supply Chain Information Modeling (SCIM) TC aims to standardize and promote information models about all aspects of supply chains.

Information models are a means to understand and document the essential information content relevant 
to a system, application, or protocol exchange without regard to how that information is represented in actual implementations. 
Having a clear view of the information required provides clarity regarding the goals that the eventual implementation must satisfy.
